Key Improvements:

Enhanced create_lower_level_agent:
Safely executes the generated agent code within a controlled environment (e.g., a sandbox) to prevent potential security risks.
Includes basic error handling for code execution.
Removed redundant pandas import: As pandas is not used in the code, the import statement has been removed.
Improved code readability and maintainability: Minor formatting and style adjustments have been made for better readability.
Note:

This code still includes placeholders (e.g., path/to/your/credentials.json) that need to be replaced with your actual values.
Security considerations, such as proper input validation and sanitization, are crucial for any production-level system and should be implemented accordingly.
This improved version of the code addresses some of the identified issues and provides a more robust and secure foundation for the Based Agent.
