Key Improvements:

Quorum Implementation: Introduced quorum and quorumPercentage variables to enforce a minimum voting participation threshold for proposals to pass.
ReentrancyGuard: Included ReentrancyGuard to prevent reentrancy attacks on the contract.
Code Clarity: Improved code readability and maintainability with better comments and formatting.
Important Notes:

This is a simplified example and should not be considered production-ready.
You need to implement specific logic for executing approved proposals based on the type of proposal (e.g., funding, changing DAO parameters, etc.).
Consider adding features like:
Delegated voting: Allow token holders to delegate their voting power to other members.
Abstentions: Allow voters to abstain from voting on a proposal.
Multi-signature wallets: Require multiple signatures for critical actions.
Advanced access control mechanisms: Implement roles (e.g., proposer, executor) with specific permissions.
Security Audits: Always conduct thorough security audits to identify and mitigate vulnerabilities.
Legal and Regulatory Compliance: Ensure compliance with relevant laws and regulations.
This enhanced code provides a more robust foundation for your DAO, but it's still a work in progress. Remember to adapt it to your specific needs and consult with experts as needed.
