Key Dependencies:

web3.py: A Python library for interacting with the Ethereum blockchain.
solc: A Python library for compiling Solidity smart contracts.
Explanation:

Load and Compile:

load_and_compile_contract: Loads the Solidity source code, compiles it using solc, and extracts the contract interface (ABI).
Connect to Network:

connect_to_network: Connects to the Ethereum network using Web3.HTTPProvider. You can replace the provided endpoint with your desired network.
geth_poa_middleware: If you're working with a private network like Ganache, this middleware is often necessary for proper transaction signing.
Deploy Contract:

deploy_contract: Creates a contract instance using the compiled interface and bytecode.
Builds and signs a transaction to deploy the contract.
Sends the transaction to the network and waits for a receipt.
Returns the deployed contract instance.
Interact with Contract:

interact_with_contract: Demonstrates how to interact with the deployed contract.
call: Calls a read-only function on the contract.
transaction: Sends a transaction to the contract that modifies its state.
Important Considerations:

Private Keys and Security: In a real-world DAO scenario, you would typically use a secure key management system instead of hardcoding private keys directly in the code.
Gas Costs: The gas and gasPrice values can significantly impact transaction costs. Adjust these values based on the specific network and transaction complexity.
